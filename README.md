# Malc (Modern Calculator Programming Language)

## Purpose
I ended up making this programming language for the entire purpose of making it easier to write applications for the HP Prime calculator

The visual style of the language has inspiration from rust and java

I wanted to simplify the process of making apps for the calculator, so I can make more and more complex programs without being bogged down by a language that feels awful to use

## Usage
malc.exe -- <source_file>

This will produce a txt file with the hp prime calculator programming language that you can use in any application.

Kinda like typescript turning into javascript
